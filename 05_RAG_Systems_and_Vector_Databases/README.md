# Week 5: RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) System

## Project Title

**Expert Knowledge Worker** - Enterprise RAG System for Insurance Tech

## Problem Statement

Organizations have vast amounts of internal knowledge scattered across documents, databases, and employee expertise. Traditional search systems fail to provide contextual, accurate answers to business questions, leading to inefficient knowledge discovery and potential misinformation in critical decision-making processes.

### Core Features:

- **Intelligent Knowledge Retrieval**: Vector-based similarity search across company documents
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Accurate answers grounded in company-specific information
- **Multi-Source Integration**: Unified querying across employee profiles and product documentation
- **Cost Optimization**: Efficient use of LLM resources with smart context selection
- **Production Interface**: User-friendly Gradio web interface for business users
- **Accuracy Safeguards**: Robust handling of out-of-scope queries and hallucination prevention

## Technical Stack

- **Vector Database**: Chroma for efficient similarity search and retrieval
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for cost-effective generation
- **Framework**: LangChain for RAG pipeline orchestration
- **Interface**: Gradio for production web interface
- **Storage**: File-based knowledge base with structured document management
- **Processing**: Custom context retrieval and relevance scoring

## Key Achievement

üèÜ **Built enterprise-grade RAG system with production deployment** - Demonstrates mastery of the most commercially applicable LLM technique, with direct business value and cost optimization considerations.

## Setup & Usage Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenAI API key (or Ollama for local development)
- Sufficient disk space for vector database storage

### Environment Setup

1. **Navigate to week5 directory**:

   ```bash
   cd llm_engineering/week5
   ```

2. **Install RAG-specific dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install chromadb langchain-chroma gradio openai python-dotenv
   ```

3. **Prepare knowledge base**:

   ```bash
   # Knowledge base structure
   knowledge-base/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ employees/          # Employee profile documents
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ products/           # Product documentation
   ```

4. **Configure environment**:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
   ```

### Running the RAG System

1. **Initialize vector database**:

   ```bash
   python VectorstoreManager.py
   ```

2. **Launch the knowledge assistant**:

   ```bash
   jupyter lab day1.ipynb
   ```

3. **Access web interface**:
   - Run the Gradio interface cells
   - Open the provided local URL
   - Start querying the knowledge base

### Local Development Alternative

```python
# Use Ollama for free local inference
from openai import OpenAI
openai = OpenAI(base_url='http://localhost:11434/v1', api_key='ollama')
MODEL = "llama3.2"
```
