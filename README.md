### Important Notes for Development

**Environment Setup**: This portfolio uses modern LLM frameworks and requires proper API keys for full functionality. Free alternatives using Ollama are provided for local development.

**API Usage**: Projects demonstrate integration with major LLM providers. Costs are minimal (typically under $5 total) for running all examples.

**Local Development**: Use Ollama for free local LLM inference:

```python
from openai import OpenAI
openai = OpenAI(base_url='http://localhost:11434/v1', api_key='ollama')
# Replace model names like 'gpt-4o-mini' with 'llama3.2'
```

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

- **LLMHandler.py**: Custom LLM abstraction layer supporting multiple providers
- **key_utils.py**: Secure API key management and rotation
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns across all projects

### Development Approach

- **Hands-on Learning**: Every project built from scratch with deep understanding
- **Production-Ready**: Code follows enterprise-level standards and best practices
- **Scalable Solutions**: Designed for real-world deployment scenarios
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive inline documentation and project guides
