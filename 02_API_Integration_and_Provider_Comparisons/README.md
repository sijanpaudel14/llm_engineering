# Week 2: Multi-Provider LLM Integration

## Project Title

**Universal LLM API Gateway** - Multi-Provider Model Comparison Platform

## Problem Statement

Modern LLM development requires flexibility to work with multiple providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) to optimize for cost, performance, and capabilities. Managing different APIs, authentication methods, and response formats creates complexity and vendor lock-in risks.

## Solution & Key Features

Developed a unified interface for integrating and comparing multiple frontier LLM providers, enabling seamless switching between models and comprehensive performance analysis.

### Core Features:

- **Multi-Provider Integration**: OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini APIs
- **Unified Interface**: Single codebase for multiple LLM providers
- **Model Comparison**: Side-by-side performance and capability testing
- **Cost Optimization**: Automatic model selection based on task requirements
- **Robust Authentication**: Secure API key management across providers
- **Error Handling**: Provider-specific error recovery and fallback mechanisms

## Technical Stack

- **LLM Providers**: OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini), Anthropic (Claude), Google (Gemini)
- **Authentication**: Environment-based API key management
- **Integration**: Native provider SDKs with custom abstraction layer
- **Development**: Python async/await patterns for concurrent requests
- **Configuration**: Flexible provider switching and model selection

## Key Achievement

üèÜ **Built production-ready multi-provider LLM system** - Demonstrates enterprise-level architecture thinking and ability to design vendor-agnostic solutions that reduce technical debt and increase flexibility.

## Setup & Usage Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google (optional - can work with subset)
