\chapter{System Overview and Architecture}

\section{Introduction}

This document provides an exhaustive technical analysis of a sophisticated Python-based multi-agent system designed for automated deal discovery, analysis, and notification. The system represents a compelling example of modern software engineering principles, combining object-oriented programming, machine learning, web scraping, API integration, and distributed computing into a cohesive, production-ready application.

The system operates as an intelligent deal-hunting assistant that continuously monitors RSS feeds from deal websites, applies multiple machine learning models to estimate product prices, identifies potentially valuable deals by comparing estimated prices with actual prices, and automatically notifies users of significant opportunities through various messaging channels.

\subsection{System Purpose and Goals}

The primary objective of this multi-agent system is to automate the process of finding profitable deals across multiple online retailers. The system accomplishes this through several key capabilities:

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0.5em]
\item \textbf{Autonomous Deal Discovery}: Continuously monitors RSS feeds from deal aggregation websites like DealNews to identify new product offers
\item \textbf{Intelligent Price Estimation}: Employs multiple machine learning approaches including ensemble methods, fine-tuned language models, and traditional ML algorithms to predict fair market prices
\item \textbf{Opportunity Analysis}: Calculates potential savings by comparing estimated fair prices against offered deal prices
\item \textbf{Automated Notification}: Delivers alerts through multiple channels (SMS, push notifications) when significant deals are identified
\item \textbf{Memory Management}: Maintains awareness of previously processed deals to avoid duplicate notifications
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Technical Architecture Overview}

The system employs a modular, agent-based architecture where each component (agent) has specialized responsibilities. This design pattern promotes separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability. The architecture can be categorized into several layers:

\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.5em]
\item \textbf{Orchestration Layer}: The PlanningAgent coordinates the entire workflow
\item \textbf{Data Acquisition Layer}: ScannerAgent and deals processing handle external data retrieval
\item \textbf{Machine Learning Layer}: Multiple specialized agents provide price estimation using different ML approaches
\item \textbf{Communication Layer}: MessagingAgent handles user notifications
\item \textbf{Foundation Layer}: Base Agent class and data models provide common functionality
\end{itemize}

\section{Agent-Based Architecture}

\subsection{The Agent Pattern}

The system implements the Agent design pattern, where each agent is an autonomous unit capable of:
\begin{itemize}
\item Independent operation with well-defined responsibilities
\item Communication and coordination with other agents
\item State management and decision making
\item Logging and monitoring of its activities
\end{itemize}

All agents inherit from a common \texttt{Agent} base class that provides:
\begin{itemize}
\item Colored console logging for visual differentiation during runtime
\item Consistent naming conventions
\item Standardized communication protocols
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Core Agents}

\paragraph{PlanningAgent (Orchestrator)}
The PlanningAgent serves as the system's central coordinator, implementing the main workflow logic. It instantiates and manages all other agents, coordinates their interactions, and makes high-level decisions about deal processing. The PlanningAgent embodies the Command pattern, orchestrating a complex sequence of operations across multiple specialized components.

\paragraph{ScannerAgent (Data Acquisition)}
Responsible for monitoring external RSS feeds and identifying new deals. The system includes two implementations:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{ScannerAgent}: Uses OpenAI's structured output API
\item \texttt{ScannerAgentLangChain}: Uses Google's Gemini via LangChain framework
\end{itemize}
Both implementations extract deal information and convert unstructured web data into structured \texttt{Deal} objects.

\paragraph{EnsembleAgent (ML Coordinator)}
Implements an ensemble machine learning approach by coordinating three different price estimation models. It uses a meta-learning approach where a Linear Regression model combines predictions from specialist models to produce final price estimates.

\paragraph{MessagingAgent (Communication)}
Handles external communications through multiple channels including SMS (via Twilio) and push notifications (via Pushover). This agent implements the Publisher pattern, broadcasting deal alerts to configured endpoints.

\subsubsection{Specialized ML Agents}

\paragraph{SpecialistAgent (Fine-tuned Model)}
Utilizes a remotely-hosted, fine-tuned language model via Modal's cloud platform. This agent represents the most sophisticated ML approach in the system, leveraging domain-specific training for price estimation.

\paragraph{FrontierAgent (RAG-based LLM)}
Implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach using vector similarity search. It finds similar products in a ChromaDB vector store and uses this context to inform price predictions via OpenAI's GPT models.

\paragraph{RandomForestAgent (Traditional ML)}
Uses a pre-trained Random Forest model combined with sentence embeddings for price prediction. This represents a more traditional machine learning approach compared to the LLM-based agents.

\section{Data Flow and System Interactions}

\subsection{Primary Workflow}

The system operates through a well-defined workflow that demonstrates sophisticated inter-agent communication:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Initialization Phase}: PlanningAgent instantiates all required agents, each performing their specific setup routines
\item \textbf{Deal Discovery}: ScannerAgent monitors RSS feeds and extracts new deals not in memory
\item \textbf{Price Analysis}: For each deal, EnsembleAgent coordinates price estimation across all ML agents
\item \textbf{Opportunity Calculation}: System compares estimated prices with deal prices to calculate potential savings
\item \textbf{Decision Making}: PlanningAgent determines whether deals meet threshold criteria for notification
\item \textbf{User Notification}: MessagingAgent delivers alerts through configured channels
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Data Models}

The system employs Pydantic models for robust data validation and serialization:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Core Data Models]
class Deal(BaseModel):
    """Structured representation of a deal"""
    product_description: str
    price: float
    url: str

class DealSelection(BaseModel):
    """Container for multiple deals"""
    deals: List[Deal]

class Opportunity(BaseModel):
    """Represents a potential profitable deal"""
    deal: Deal
    estimate: float  # ML-predicted price
    discount: float  # Estimated savings
\end{lstlisting}
