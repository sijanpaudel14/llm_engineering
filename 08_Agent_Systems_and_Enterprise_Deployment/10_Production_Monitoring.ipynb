    "\n",
    "**(Generate this part first and wait for feedback)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Provide a high-level, \"30,000-foot view\" of the system. The reader should understand the system's purpose and how the major components fit together before diving into the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "1.  **Chapter Title:** Start with `\\chapter{System Overview and Architecture}`.\n",
    "2.  **Purpose & Vision:**\n",
    "    *   Explain the overall purpose of the agent system. Use a real-world analogy (e.g., \"This system operates like a digital command center with specialized teams...\") to make the concept accessible.\n",
    "    *   Describe the problem it solves and its intended domain of operation.\n",
    "3.  **Core Concepts:**\n",
    "    *   Define what an \"agent\" is within the context of this system.\n",
    "    *   Explain the primary roles of different agent types if they exist (e.g., Manager Agents, Worker Agents, Data Agents).\n",
    "4.  **Architectural Blueprint (Diagram):**\n",
    "    *   Create a high-level architecture diagram using LaTeX's TikZ package.\n",
    "    *   The diagram should represent each Python file as a distinct node (e.g., a `box`).\n",
    "    *   Use directed arrows (`->`) to show the primary relationships and data flow between these files/modules. Label the arrows with the type of interaction (e.g., \"Instantiates,\" \"Calls function,\" \"Inherits from\").\n",
    "    *   Provide a `\\caption{}` and a `\\label{}` for the diagram.\n",
    "5.  **Component Interaction Narrative:**\n",
    "    *   Following the diagram, write a detailed narrative that walks the reader through it.\n",
    "    *   Explain how the components (files) collaborate to achieve the system's goals. For example: \"The `main.py` script acts as the entry point, responsible for initializing the `ManagerAgent` from `manager_agent.py`. The `ManagerAgent` then delegates tasks by creating instances of `WorkerAgent` found in `worker_agent.py`...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 2: File-by-File Deep Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Deconstruct each of the 7 Python files, treating each as a chapter in the book. This section serves as the primary code reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "1.  **New Chapter per File:** For each `.py` file, create a new chapter: `\\chapter{Analysis of [filename.py]}`.\n",
    "2.  **Structured Analysis Template:** Within each chapter, use the following structure:\n",
    "    *   `\\section{Purpose and Role in the System}`: Briefly describe this file's responsibility.\n",
    "    *   `\\section{Dependencies and Imports}`: List all imports and explain why they are needed. Separate standard library, third-party, and internal project imports.\n",
    "    *   `\\section{Class Definitions}`: For each class in the file:\n",
    "        *   `\\subsection{Class: [ClassName]}`\n",
    "        *   **Description:** Explain the class's purpose.\n",
    "        *   **Attributes:** List and describe its instance and class attributes.\n",
    "        *   **Methods:** List its methods. A detailed function-by-function breakdown will come in Part 4, so this is a high-level list.\n",
    "        *   **Code Listing:** Include the full class code in a `listings` block with a caption: `\\caption{Source code for the \\texttt{[ClassName]} class.}`.\n",
    "    *   `\\section{Module-Level Functions}`: If there are any functions outside of classes, document them here similarly.\n",
    "    *   `\\section{Interactions and Connections}`: Explain how this file connects to others. Example: \"The `create_task` function in this file is called by the `assign_work` method of the `ManagerAgent` class from `manager_agent.py`.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 3: Class Hierarchy and Object-Oriented Design**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Illuminate the system's object-oriented structure, focusing on inheritance, polymorphism, and composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "1.  **Chapter Title:** Start with `\\chapter{Class Hierarchy and Object-Oriented Design}`.\n",
    "2.  **Inheritance Diagram:**\n",
    "    *   Create a master class inheritance diagram using TikZ.\n",
    "    *   Parent classes should be positioned above child classes, with arrows pointing from child to parent.\n",
    "    *   Use this diagram to visually explain the \"is-a\" relationships.\n",
    "3.  **Composition vs. Inheritance:**\n",
    "    *   Dedicate a section to explaining where the system uses inheritance (`is-a`) versus composition (`has-a`).\n",
    "    *   Provide specific examples from the code for both patterns and explain the design rationale behind those choices.\n",
    "4.  **Polymorphism in Action:**\n",
    "    *   Identify any instances of polymorphism (e.g., different agent classes with the same method name, like `.execute_task()`).\n",
    "    *   Provide a code example demonstrating how a manager class can interact with different agent subclasses through a common interface, without needing to know their specific type.\n",
    "5.  **Method Resolution Order (MRO):**\n",
    "    *   For key classes involved in multiple-inheritance (if any), explicitly show and explain their MRO.\n",
    "    *   Explain how Python determines which parent method to call.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 4: Function-by-Function Execution Breakdown**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** This is the most granular part. Analyze every significant function/method, explaining its logic and its execution from a low-level Python perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "1.  **Chapter Structure:** Organize this chapter by class, then by method: `\\chapter{Detailed Function and Method Analysis}` -> `\\section{Class: [ClassName]}` -> `\\subsection{Method: [method_name]}`.\n",
    "2.  **Method Analysis Template:** For each method, provide:\n",
    "    *   **Signature and Docstring:** Display the method signature with type hints and its docstring.\n",
    "    *   **Purpose and Logic:** Describe what the method is designed to do and the high-level logic it follows.\n",
    "    *   **Parameters and Return Value:** Create a table (`\\begin{tabular}`) detailing each parameter (name, type, description) and the return value.\n",
    "    *   **Line-by-Line Execution Analysis:** This is crucial. For each line or logical block of code:\n",
    "        *   **`Line [N]: \\texttt{code_here}`**\n",
    "        *   **Action:** High-level description of what the line does.\n",
    "        *   **Python Internals:** Explain the \"behind-the-scenes\" mechanics. Examples:\n",
    "            *   *Object Instantiation:* \"Memory is allocated for a new `Worker` object. Python's `__new__` method handles the allocation, followed by `__init__`, which populates the object's `__dict__` with the instance attributes...\"\n",
    "            *   *Variable Assignment:* \"The name `task_id` is bound to the memory address of the string object in the current function's stack frame.\"\n",
    "            *   *Function Call:* \"A new frame is pushed onto the call stack for the `process_data` function. References to the arguments are passed into this new frame...\"\n",
    "        *   **System Context:** Explain the line's impact on the overall agent system's state.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 5: Python Concepts in Practice**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Use the agent system's code as a real-world textbook to teach the Python concepts it employs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "1.  **Chapter Title:** `\\chapter{Core Python Concepts Illustrated}`.\n",
    "2.  **Concept-Driven Sections:** Create a section for each major Python concept found in the code. Look for (but don't be limited to):\n",
    "    *   Decorators, Special Methods (`__init__`, `__str__`, etc.), Context Managers (`with` statement), Generators and Iterators, Closures, Metaclasses, Exception Handling, Concurrency/Parallelism (if used).\n",
    "3.  **Three-Part Explanation Structure:** For each concept:\n",
    "    *   `\\subsection{[Concept Name]}`\n",
    "    *   **1. Generic Explanation:** Define the concept in general terms.\n",
    "    *   **2. Simple Illustrative Example:** Provide a minimal, \"toy\" code example to demonstrate the concept in isolation.\n",
    "    *   **3. Application in the Agent System:** Show a snippet from the actual agent code where this concept is used. Explain *why* it was used there and what benefits it provides to the system's design.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 6: Live Agent Interaction & Execution Flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Simulate a complete, end-to-end workflow to show how all the pieces dynamically interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "1.  **Chapter Title:** `\\chapter{End-to-End Execution Trace}`.\n",
    "2.  **Scenario Definition:** Define a clear, concrete scenario. E.g., \"Tracing a single data processing task from its creation by the user to its completion by a worker agent and the final reporting of the result.\"\n",
    "3.  **Sequence Diagram:**\n",
    "    *   Create a detailed sequence diagram using a LaTeX package like `pgf-umlsd` or TikZ.\n",
    "    *   Each vertical lifeline should represent a specific agent *instance* (e.g., `manager_agent_1`, `worker_agent_A`).\n",
    "    *   Horizontal arrows must represent method calls, with parameters included. Dashed arrows should show return values.\n",
    "4.  **Narrative Walkthrough:**\n",
    "    *   Provide a step-by-step narrative that follows the sequence diagram.\n",
    "    *   **Step 1:** The `main` function instantiates `ManagerAgent`.\n",
    "    *   **Step 2:** `ManagerAgent.add_task()` is called. Describe how the task is stored internally.\n",
    "    *   **Step 3:** `ManagerAgent` selects and dispatches the task to a `WorkerAgent`.\n",
    "    *   ...and so on, until the task is complete.\n",
    "    *   Explicitly mention state changes in each object as the scenario progresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "        *   **Intermediate (Essential for this System):** Classes, objects, inheritance, exception handling, file I/O.\n",
    "        *   **Advanced (To Master the Design):** Decorators, generators, context managers, and any other advanced concepts you identified in Part 5.\n",
    "4.  **Final Thoughts:** Offer some concluding remarks on the system's design, its strengths, and potential areas for extension or improvement.\n",
    "5.  **Closing LaTeX:** End with `\\end{document}`.\n",
